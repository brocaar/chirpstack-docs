          <h1>ChirpStack, open-source LoRaWAN<sup>&reg;</sup> Network Server stack</h1>
          <p>
            The ChirpStack open-source LoRaWAN Network Server stack provides open-source components for LoRaWAN networks.
            Together they form a ready-to-use solution including an user-friendly web-interface for device management and
            APIs for integration. The modular architecture makes it possible to integrate within existing infrastructures.
            All components are licensed under the MIT license and can be used for commercial purposes.

          <h2>Feature highlights</h2>
          <div class="grid">
            <div>
              <h4>Class-A support</h4>
              <p>
                End-devices of Class A allow for bi-directional communications whereby
                each end-device‘s uplink transmission is followed by two short downlink
                receive windows. The transmission slot scheduled by the end-device is
                based on its own communication needs with a small variation based on
                a random time basis (ALOHA-type of protocol).
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Class-B support</h4>
              <p>
                End-devices of Class B allow for more receive slots. In addition to
                the Class A random receive windows, Class B devices open extra
                receive windows at scheduled times. In order for the End-device to
                open it receive window at the scheduled time it receives a time
                synchronized Beacon from the gateway.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Class-C support</h4>
              <p>
                End-devices of Class C have nearly continuously open receive windows,
                only closed when transmitting. Class C end-device will use more power
                to operate than Class A or Class B but they offer the lowest latency
                for server to end-device communication.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Adaptive data-rate</h4>
              <p>
                When the end-device has ADR enabled, the ChirpStack LoRaWAN
                network-server will ensure that the device will operate using the most
                efficient data-rate and tx-power. this will not only save energy at
                the device-side, but will also optimize the usage of the radio spectrum,
                lowering the risk of collisions.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Live frame-logging</h4>
              <p>
                The ChirpStack LoRaWAN application-server provides live
                frame-logging per gateway and device. It will display all the RX / TX
                meta-data, together with the raw LoRaWAN PHYPayload
                in a readable format. It is like Wireshark for LoRaWAN!
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Channel (re)configuration</h4>
              <p>
                Whether you want to use a sub-set of the LoRaWAN
                defined channels (e.g. for the US band) or want to configure
                additional channels (e.g. for the EU band), the ChirpStack LoRaWAN
                network-server will make sure the device stays always in sync with
                the network configured channels (using the CFList field and / or
                mac-commands).
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Multi-tenant</h4>
              <p>
                The ChirpStack LoRaWAN application-server supports the
                creation of multiple organizations to which (administrator) users can
                be assigned. By integrating the user-accounts into the MQTT broker
                authentication, organizations will only see their own data.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>APIs and integration</h4>
              <p>
                All ChirpStack components provide gRPC and / or REST APIs for integration
                with external services. By default all application data is published
                to a MQTT broker, however integrations are available for various
                cloud-providers, databases and visualization platforms.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>LoRaWAN 1.0 and 1.1 compatible</h4>
              <p>
                The ChirpStack LoRaWAN network-server supports
                LoRaWAN 1.0 and LoRaWAN 1.1
                devices simultaniously, including all LoRaWAN
                Regional Parameter Specification revisions and bands.
              </p>
            </div>
