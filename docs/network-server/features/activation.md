# Device activation

## Over The Air Activation (OTAA)

In case of a LoRaWAN<sup>&reg;</sup> OTAA activation request, ChirpStack Network Server will call the Join Server configured
in the [Configuration](../install/config.md) file which will
handle the authentication of the device and the generation of the session-keys.
The Join Server API is specified by the [LoRaWAN Backend Interfaces](https://www.lora-alliance.org/lorawan-for-developers)
specification. By default [ChirpStack Application Server](../../application-server/index.md)
fulfills this role.

## Activation By Personalization (ABP)

In case of a LoRaWAN ABP devices, ChirpStack Network Server has support for pre-activating devices through its
[API](../integrate/api.md). Once activated, ChirpStack Network Server will handle the
device in exactly the same way as an OTAA activated device.
