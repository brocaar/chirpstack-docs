# Raspberry Pi install

## ChirpStack Gateway OS

ChirpStack provides an embedded OS called the [ChirpStack Gateway OS](../../gateway-os/index.md)
which supports Raspberry Pi based gateways. Please refer to the
[ChirpStack Gateway OS](../../gateway-os/index.md) documentation for more information and
[Raspberry Pi installation](/gateway-os/install/raspberrypi/) instructions.

## Raspbian

As an alternative to the [ChirpStack Gateway OS](../../gateway-os/index.md), it is also possible
to install the ChirpStack stack on top of [Raspbian](http://raspbian.org/). As
Raspbian is based on Debian, you can follow the [Quickstart Debian / Ubuntu](debian-ubuntu.md)
guide.
