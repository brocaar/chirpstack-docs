# ChirpStack architecture

The graph below visualizes how the ChirpStack LoRaWAN<sup>&reg;</sup> Network Server
components are connected:

## LoRaWAN devices

The LoRaWAN devices (not pictured in the above graph) are
the devices sending data to the ChirpStack Network Server (through one or multiple
LoRa Gateways). These devices could be for example sensors
measuring air quality, temperature, humidity, location...

## LoRa<sup>&reg;</sup> Gateway

A LoRa Gateway listens to (usually) 8 or more channels
simultaneously and forwards received data (from devices) to a
LoRaWAN network-server (in this case the ChirpStack Network Server).
The software running on the LoRa Gateway responsible for
receiving and sending is called a Packet Forwarder. Common implementations
are the [Semtech UDP Packet Forwarder](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder/)
and the [Semtech Basic Station Packet Forwarder](https://doc.sm.tc/station/).

## ChirpStack Gateway Bridge

The [ChirpStack Gateway Bridge](../gateway-bridge/index.md) sits between the Packet
Forwarder and MQTT broker. It transforms the Packet Forwarder format (like the
[Semtech UDP Packet Forwarder protocol](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder/blob/master/PROTOCOL.TXT))
into a data-format used by the ChirpStack components. It also provides integrations
with various cloud platforms like [GCP Cloud IoT Core](https://cloud.google.com/iot-core/)
and [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/).

## ChirpStack Network Server

The [ChirpStack Network Server](../network-server/index.md) is a LoRaWAN
Network Server, responsible for managing the state of the network.
It has knowledge of device activations on the network and is able to handle
join-requests when devices want to join the network. 

When data is received by multiple gateways, the ChirpStack Network Server will
de-duplicate this data and forward it as one payload to the
ChirpStack Application Server. When an application-server needs to send data back
to a device, the ChirpStack Network Server will keep these items in queue, until
it is able to send to one of the gateways.

## ChirpStack Application Server

The [ChirpStack Application Server](../application-server/index.md) is a LoRaWAN
Application Server, compatible with the ChirpStack Network Server. It provides a
web-interface and APIs for management of users, organizations, applications,
gateways and devices.

Received uplink data is forwarded to one or multiple configured integrations.

## End-application

The end-application receives the device-data through one of the configured
integrations. It can use the ChirpStack Application Server API in order to schedule
a downlink payload to the devices.
The purpose of an end-application could be analytics, alerting,
data visualization, triggering actions, ...
