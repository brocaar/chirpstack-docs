## What is LoRaWAN?

LoRaWAN is an open LPWAN data link standard maintained by the
[LoRa Alliance](https://www.lora-alliance.org). In the OSI stack model, LoRaWAN
would correspond to the Media access control (MAC) layer. Typically, LoRaWAN
uses LoRa as a PHY layer. LoRa is a proprietary spread spectrum modulation
scheme that is derivative of Chirp Spread Spectrum modulation (CSS) and which
trades data rate for sensitivity within a fixed channel bandwidth.

### Specification

#### LoRaWAN specification

The LoRaWAN specification describes the LoRaWAN network protocol, including
MAC layer commands.

#### LoRaWAN regional parameters

The LoRaWAN Regional Parameters document contains the channel frequency plans
and variables for various global regions.
