# Raspberry Pi install

The LoRa Server project provides scripts for generating
[Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) based images
with all LoRa Server components and requirements (including the
[packet-forwarder](https://github.com/lora-net/packet_forwarder/)) installed.

This can be used when building an all-in-one Raspberry Pi LoRa Gateway with
LoRaWAN network-server.

Refer to the [https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver-pi-gen](https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver-pi-gen)
repository for scripts and instructions.
