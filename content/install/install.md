## Installing the LoRa Server project

There are multiple ways how the LoRa Server project could be setup:

### Guides

The following guides are a great introduction to get you started with the
LoRa Server project:

* [Full installation on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS]({{< ref "install/guides/ubuntu-xenial-install.md" >}})

### Manual

In this case you need to download the binaries for each component (matching
your platform and architecture) and make sure they are started on boot.
For this you could use [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd)
unit-files or [init](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init) script, based
on the platform you're using.

Pre-compiled binaries and packages can be found at:

* [LoRa Gateway Bridge downloads](/lora-gateway-bridge/overview/downloads/)
* [LoRa Server downloads](/loraserver/overview/downloads/)
* [LoRa App Server downloads](/lora-app-server/overview/downloads/)

### Debian / Ubuntu

The LoRa Server project provides pre-compiled binaries packaged as Debian (.deb)
packages. In order to activate this repository, execute the following
commands:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 1CE2AFD36DBCCA00

export DISTRIB_ID=`lsb_release -si`
export DISTRIB_CODENAME=`lsb_release -sc`
sudo echo "deb https://repos.loraserver.io/${DISTRIB_ID,,} ${DISTRIB_CODENAME} testing" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/loraserver.list
sudo apt-get update
```

Then to install all components:

```bash
sudo apt-get install lora-gateway-bridge loraserver lora-app-server
```

Note that after installing, you still need to configure each component.
Configuration files are located in
`/etc/default/(lora-gateway-bridge|loraserver|lora-app-server)`.

Please refer to the documentation of each component for more details about
setting up and configuration:

* [LoRa Gateway Bridge](/lora-gateway-bridge/)
* [LoRa Server](/loraserver/)
* [LoRa App Server](/lora-app-server/)

### Vagrant (using VirtualBox)

In case you would like to setup a local test environment to experiment with
the LoRa Server project, an easy option is by using the LoRa Server setup
scripts, which can be used both for a local Vagrant based setup as for remote
deployments: [https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver-setup](https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver-setup).

### Ansible based deployments

The LoRa Server setup playbook for Ansible will setup the LoRa Server project
for you, including its dependencies. The same playbook is used to provision
the Vagrant box (see above). See for instructions:
[https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver-setup](https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver-setup).
